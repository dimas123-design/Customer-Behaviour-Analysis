    **Findings:**
    - Most customers are between 25-35 years old.
    - The "Clothing" category has the highest number of transactions.
    - However, the category with the highest total revenue may be different (e.g., "Electronics").
    - Most customers fall into the "Regular" category.
    - The average transaction per customer is lower for "Regular Customers" compared to "Gold Customers".

    **Recommendations:**
    - Make loyalty programs more attractive to encourage "Regular" customers to upgrade to "Silver" or "Gold".
    - Increase promotions for less popular product categories.
    - Focus on **high-revenue product categories**, not just those with the most transactions.
    - Further analyze customers with **low purchase frequency** to improve retention.
